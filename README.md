# STAT-628-BODYFAT-MODEL
# GROUP17-SUNGRIM LEE, XIAO LI, MAX ZOU

## Summary 
### This repository contains an IMAGE folder, and codes for EDA, modeling, and shiny app within CODE folder, as well as a DATA folder for BODYFAT prediction modeling. Our group tried to build a model as simple with a few number of features, which gave us a linear regression model with two features left, Abdomen and Height.


## Project Environment
### Python 3 - EDA on Mac Pro
### Libraries: NumPy-1.21.5, Pandas-1.4.1, sklearn-1.1.1, matplotlib-3.5.1, seaborn-0.11.2

## Implementation

# BodyFat.csv within the DATA folder as an input file, one can implement EDA part with the BodyFat_EDA.ipynb file.
# 
# For the Shiny App, Open a R studio and Import the Shiny App code file, and excute it in order.
