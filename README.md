# STAT-628-BODYFAT-MODEL
## GROUP17-SUNGRIM LEE, XIAO LI, MAX ZOU

## Summary 
### This repository contains an IMAGE folder, and codes for EDA, modeling, and shiny app within CODE folder, as well as a DATA folder for BODYFAT prediction modeling. Our group tried to build a model as simple with a few number of features, which gave us a linear regression model with two features left, Abdomen and Height.


## Project Environment
### Python 3 - EDA on Mac Pro
### Libraries: NumPy-1.21.5, Pandas-1.4.1, sklearn-1.1.1, matplotlib-3.5.1, seaborn-0.11.2

## Implementation

### 1. BodyFat.csv within the DATA folder as an input file, one can implement EDA part with the BodyFat_EDA.ipynb file.
### 2. For Modeling, with the raw data file in working directory, implement codes in the script in order or knit the rmd file immediately.
### 3. Diagnostics, similar to 2., implement codes in the script in order or knit the rmd file immediately.
### 4. For the Shiny App, Open a R studio and Import the Shiny App.R code file, and excute it in order.
